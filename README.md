#  AI for Accessible Education  

##  Overview  
This project is an **adaptive learning platform** that personalizes courses based on the user’s learning preferences and personality traits. The system utilizes the **RAISEC personality test** to generate customized lesson plans, quizzes, and assessments. As users progress, the course dynamically adjusts to their performance, ensuring an optimized learning experience.

##  Key Features  
 **Topic Selection** – Users enter a specific topic they want to learn.  
 **RAISEC Personality Test** – Determines the user’s learning style.  
 **Personalized Course Generation** – Creates lesson plans, quizzes, and assessments tailored to the user’s personality.  
 **Adaptive Learning System** – Modifies course structure based on assessment results.  
 **Feedback & Progress Tracking** – Users can track progress and provide feedback upon course completion.

##  User Flow  
1️ **Enter Learning Topic** → Users specify a subject they want to learn.  
2️ **Complete RAISEC Test** → A short test assesses personality-based learning preferences.  
3️ **Generate Personalized Course** → The platform creates a custom lesson plan with quizzes & assessments.  
4️ **Dynamic Course Adjustments** → The course adapts based on user performance in quizzes.  
5️ **Completion & Feedback** → Users receive a certificate and are prompted for feedback.

## 🛠 Technology Stack  
**Frontend**: [Lovable-generated UI components] (React.js, TailwindCSS, or similar modern frameworks)  
**Backend**: Node.js / Express.js (for handling user data and course personalization)  
**Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (to store user progress, test results, and course content)  
**AI Integration**: (Optional) Machine learning models to improve adaptation accuracy

##  Future Enhancements  
🔹 **AI-based learning insights & recommendations**  
🔹 **Integration with external learning platforms** (e.g., Coursera, Khan Academy)  
🔹 **Gamification elements** (badges, streaks, leaderboards)  

##  Contributing  

Contributors are more than welcome to improve the project by creating a new issue to **report bugs, suggest new features, or make changes** to the source code by submitting a **pull request (PR)**.  

To have your work merged in, please ensure the following:  

###  Contribution Process  
1. **Fork the Repository** (if you are not a contributor) and create your branch from `master`.  
   - If you are already a contributor, create a new **development branch** with a relevant name.  
2. **Push your commits** to the aforementioned fork/branch.  
3. **Keep changes within scope** – Avoid committing irrelevant changes that are unrelated to the PR.  
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** in the main repository.  
5. **Describe Your Changes** – If you've fixed a bug or added a new feature, provide a **clear and comprehensive list of changes** in your PR description.  
6. **Ensure Code Quality** – Make sure your code is:  
   - **Tested** and fully functional.  
   - **Linted** and follows clean coding practices.  
7. **Merging into Master** – When merging into `master`, it is highly recommended to use **"Squash and Merge"** instead of "Create a Merge Commit" to prevent cluttering the commit history.
