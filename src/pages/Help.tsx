    {
      question: "How does the personality assessment work?",
      answer: "Our platform uses the RAISEC model (Realistic, Artistic, Investigative, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) to understand your learning preferences. This assessment helps us tailor the learning experience to match how you best absorb and process information."

      question: "Is all the educational content original?",

    },
    {
      question: "Why focus on content curation?",
      answer: "There's an abundance of free, high-quality educational content available online. The real challenge isn't access to informationâ€”it's finding the right information in the right order, presented in a way that matches your learning style. That's the problem we solve."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure my learning progress?",
      answer: "We use a combination of quizzes, assessments, engagement metrics, and completion rates to gauge your understanding and progress. This data helps us adapt the course to reinforce concepts you find challenging and move quickly through material you grasp easily."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is accessible education important?",
      answer: "We believe education is a fundamental right. By curating freely available content and personalizing the learning experience, we're making quality education more accessible to everyone, regardless of economic or geographic constraints."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I suggest improvements to the platform?",
